# Estimate-Pi

Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms
that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to
use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used
in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to
use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes:[1] optimization,
numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.

This code is an interactive application that estimates the value of pi
using the unit square unit circle method.

pi = 4 * (number of points in the circle)/(number of points in the square)
